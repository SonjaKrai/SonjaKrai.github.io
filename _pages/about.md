I am a DPhil student in Computer science under the supervision of Edith Elkind supported by an EPSRC Scholarship. I am broadly interested in algorithmic social choice, algorithmic game theory and mechanism design.
Previously, I studied for an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science (MFoCS) at the University of Oxford and a BSc (Hons) in  Computing Science and Mathematics at the University of Glasgow.
